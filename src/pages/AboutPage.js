            Try to follow your normal work routine to stay productive. If you normally shower every morning or
            listen to a podcast on your commute, you should still do those things. It sets the right tone for
            the day (whatever that may be). Also, it’s important to stay flexible, but also maintain boundaries
            for your working hours. I find it incredibly easy to lose track of time working and, before I know
            it, it’s 9 p.m.! Set expectations with your manager on when you plan to be online, and whether you
            need to be available outside your 9-5.
